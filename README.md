**Docker Login Page** project entails building a real-time docker based web application featuring login and signup functionalities, crafted using docker, git, PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQL. To ensure seamless deployment and scalability, we‚Äôve leveraged Docker technology to containerize the application. This involved creating distinct images for the frontend and backend components.  
To orchestrate these containers effectively, Docker Compose was employed, facilitating their build and runtime configurations. Networking capabilities within Docker were utilized to establish communication between the frontend and backend containers, enabling full-stack functionality. Additionally, we implemented volume management to facilitate regular backups of the SQL tabular database, ensuring data integrity and resilience.  
In terms of version control and collaboration, we‚Äôve adopted Git and GitHub as our source control management platform. Following established branching strategies, including development, pre-production, production, and main branches, ensures streamlined development workflows and efficient collaboration among team members.
